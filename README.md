# Analog Box

Analog Box (aka ABox or ABox2) is an open source, circuit based, modular software synthesizer for Microsoft Windows platforms. You put sound objects on the screen, connect them together, listen and adjust. ABox was developed between 1998 and 2004 by Andy Turner at andyware.com. The software and web pages now reside here at [Google Sites](https://sites.google.com/site/analogbox2/).

# A Note

ABox2 was groundbreaking when it was first released around 1998 and in my opinion a significant project in computer music history.

Realtime software-based synthesizers were just beginning to take flight around that time. ABox was a one-person project that implemented a realtime modular synth in pure assembly language, enabling it to be performant on 1998-era consumer hardware. 

Since few people are aware of this project and its significance in 2020, I felt it was of some value to make sure the effort was preserved with at least one more mirror on the internet so that it's not accidentally lost to time.
